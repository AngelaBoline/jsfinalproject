<h1 class="col2">A change of space</h1>
<h2 class="col2">A busy couple removed a wall to amplify their Bay Harbor Islands home</h2>

<div id="page1">
<p class="col2">Shortly after Jennifer Corredor’s interior design clients bought a four-bedroom, three- bath home last year, the couple suffered through a period of buyer’s remorse. Mathy Garcia Chesnick, a sales director with Cervera Real Estate, and husband Andrew Chesnick, an executive for the new Porsche Design Tower residential project in Sunny Isles, liked the idea of incorporating the kitchen area into the living and dining spaces. Since they have two young children, the couple felt those areas were too narrow for easy, open living.</p>

<p class="col2">While they loved the Bay Harbor Islands location and the 4,000-square-foot, one-story home’s potential for beauty and ample entertaining space, they felt the living and dining areas were too restricted and looked very small. They feared they had bought the wrong house. “My clients thought the brown wall separating these spaces from the kitchen created a somber mood and darkness, and they were unhappy after they had bought the house,” says Corredor of the J. Design Group in Coral Gables. “So we decided to tear down the wall to make a galley kitchen.”</p>

<p class="col3"> At first, Corredor was afraid a structural beam could get in the way and impede the restoration process. But after doing research, she learned that problem did not exist, and there was nothing to hinder the project from moving forward. So she collapsed the wall to create one large kitchen, living and dining space. Then she changed the flooring using 36x36-inch light slabs of gold Bianco marble, replacing the wood that had been there before. This process also enlarged the look of the space, giving it lightness, brightness and zoom. “By eliminating the wall and adding the marble we amplified the new and expanded public area,” says Corredor, who is known for optimizing space in creative ways. “And I used sheer white window treatments which further opened things up creating an airy, balmy space. The transformation is astonishing! It looks like a different place.” Part of that transformation included stripping the “awful” brown kitchen cabinets and replacing them with clean-lined, white ones from Italy. She also added a functional island and mint chocolate granite countertops. At one end of the kitchen space, Corredor designed dark wood shelving where Mathy displays her collection of cookbooks.</p>

<p class="col2">“Mathy cooks a great deal, and they entertain on a regular basis,” says Corredor. “The island we created is where she likes to serve the kids breakfast and have family members gather. And when they have a dinner party, everyone can mill in and out of the kitchen-galley, dining and living areas while able to see everything going on around them. It looks and functions so much better.” Corredor extended the Bianco marble flooring to other open areas of the house, nearly everywhere except for the bedrooms. She also changed the powder room, which is annexed to the kitchen. She applied white linear glass on the walls and added a new white square sink by Hastings. Clean and fresh, the room is reminiscent of a little jewel box. </p>

<p class="col2">In the living room, Corredor designed a showpiece wall unit of exotic cherry wood with an aqua center to bring back some warmth that modernizing naturally strips away. The designer also changed the room’s lighting, introducing a new system that eschews a switch. Instead, it works by remote and also dims to create various moods for different social engagements. “The lighting is wonderful and enhances everything else we have done in these open spaces,” says Corredor. </p>

<p class="col3"> The dining room overlooks the pool and yard, with large, floor-to-ceiling window brings the outdoors inside. A chandelier above the dining table is another expression of openness, like the lens of a person’s eyeglasses. “We wanted this unusual piece because its sort of translucence takes you outside without ever moving from the room,” explains Corredor. “The family members love seeing the yard and pool from the living and dining space. It’s also great for entertaining friends and business associates. They can get a real feel for the subtropical elegance of Miami.” Nearby, the front door was originally brown so she repainted it a sleek lacquered white. This bright consistency helps maintain a constant eye flow from one section of the open areas to another. Everything is visible in the new extended space and creates a bright and inviting atmosphere. “The owners are thrilled, and we were able to complete the renovation in a few months,” says Corredor. “Everything turned out how it should be.” </p>
